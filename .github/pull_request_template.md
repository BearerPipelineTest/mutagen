<!--

Please note: Mutagen is currently in a state of high code churn and I simply
don't have the time to review pull requests. GitHub unfortunately doesn't allow
me to disable pull requests, but please be aware that they will probably be left
on the back burner for the foreseeable future. Sorry :-(

â€“ Jacob


In any case, before taking the time to implement a change or feature, please
discuss the proposed change on the Mutagen Community Slack Workspace:

https://mutagen.io/slack


If it *does* make sense to open a pull request, please adhere to the
contributing guidelines:

https://github.com/mutagen-io/mutagen/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

They're not too onerous. Pull requests that don't follow these guidelines will
simply be closed.
